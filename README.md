## AMBU-MAPS
I have made a app which will track Users Current Location And Show All the Active Ambulances Nearby.
When A particular Ambulance is within 2 km from Users Current location Immediately an Alert will produce
on top of App stating the ambulance is near us please stay aware and start driving from left Side so that 
Ambulance can Drive Fast from Right Side and reach hospital as soon as possible.
